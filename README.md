Description & Notes on edits  - This code has been refactored in an effort to clean the code for easier future use and create a more accessible website. 

Duplicate/unnecessary styling has been placed in the "cutstyling.css" file in case it is needed in the future. 

Image alt text added. 

In mock-up the footer was removed, but I left it in. Would ask for clarity in real world.

Added comments to HTML and CSS for clarity

HTML articles and header now auto size and will not overflow out of their containers

Headings made more clear

Homepage title adjusted for maximum clarity

Navigation links fixed
